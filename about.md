Hi, I'm Jason. I'm using this site as a test project to learn about Jekyll. I'll be displaying a small portfolio of projects. This is the first time I've used GitHub pages, Jekyll and markdown language, so this will be a great learning experience. I'm hoping to use these skills in the creation of client websites later.
